This plugin requires log4j version 1.2.12 or higher so in order for it to work in Jenkins 1.399 (and maybe future versions)
or older you need to replace the log4j jar bundled with the Jenkins web app if it's older than 1.2.12.
Another option I've seen being suggested is to use the java.endorsed.dirs system property to point to a location where a
newer version of log4j jar exists but I have been unable to make it work.
